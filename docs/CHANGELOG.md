# Changelog

## [Unreleased] — 0.4.0

### Added

- **Mermaid diagrams and syntax highlighting, preinstalled** — every scaffolded document can
  simply write `<pre class="mermaid">…</pre>` (or a `language-mermaid` code block) and fenced
  `<pre><code class="language-…">` blocks; a new shared enhancer
  (`.plandrop/shared/js/enhance.js`) renders them on load with **mermaid** and
  **highlight.js**, served self-hosted from `.plandrop/shared/vendor/` (no runtime CDN). The
  enhancer is lazy — a document with no diagrams or code blocks fetches nothing beyond the
  ~2KB scan — and theme-aware: both renderers follow `data-bs-theme`, the bootstrap5 toggle
  re-renders diagrams and flips the highlight stylesheet live, and a self-update body swap
  re-enhances the fresh content. The bundles are vendored from the pinned npm packages
  (licenses included) by the template generator.
- **The scaffolded starter speaks to agents** — the template body is now a single HTML
  comment addressed to the authoring agent, spelling out what is preinstalled and automatic
  (Bootstrap 5, mermaid, highlighting) and inviting it to replace the comment with the
  document. The rest of the template markup is bare — no comments; the generator recognises
  the theme-toggle block by its `data-bs-theme-toggle` attribute rather than marker comments.
- **The showcase plan demos the enhancers** — Project Bigdrop's plan gains a sequence
  diagram of the "AI enrichment" call, its exit funnel as a flowchart, and
  syntax-highlighted bash/JavaScript blocks, so every theme's showcase doc exercises
  mermaid and highlight.js.

### Changed

- **Inline code is calm green, not angry pink** — a new shared, theme-neutral override
  stylesheet (`.plandrop/shared/css/plandrop.css`, loaded after every theme's
  `bootstrap.min.css`) retunes Bootstrap's `--bs-code-color` across all themes: dark green
  (`#11632a`) on light themes, a lighter green (`#7ec699`) under `data-bs-theme="dark"`. The
  vendored Bootswatch CSS stays byte-identical to upstream — cross-theme appearance tweaks now
  have a single home that survives Bootswatch upgrades. Each generated `<html>` carries a
  `data-plandrop-theme="<name>"` attribute so the override sheet can make per-theme exceptions:
  quartz (nominally light, but its signature surface is saturated purple glass) takes the
  dark-scheme green.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-08

User-friendliness: discoverable help, guided onboarding, and a one-command localhost server.

### Added

- **`help` command** — `plandrop help` lists every command with a one-liner;
  `plandrop help <command>` (or `plandrop <command> --help`, or `-h` in any position) prints
  that command's usage, flags, and examples. A bare `plandrop` prints the overview (exit 0)
  instead of erroring, and an unknown command points at `plandrop help`. All command help text
  lives in one registry, so help and per-command usage errors can't drift apart.
- **`init` command** — guided first-run setup that *writes* the config the resolvers already
  read: the default domain (the public CDN `plandrop.dev` is offered, with its templates-only
  caveat) and optionally a default template, to either the per-user
  `~/.config/plandrop/config.json` (honours `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) or a project-local `.plandrop`.
  Both targets are merged, never clobbered — an existing `host`/`passphrase` survives — and an
  existing per-user config is not overwritten without confirmation (`--force`
  non-interactively). Scriptable via `--domain`, `--template`, `--local`/`--user`, `--yes`;
  prints the absolute path it wrote.
- **System config tier** — domain/template resolution gains an admin-managed tier below the
  per-user config: each `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` entry (default `/etc/xdg`) as
  `<dir>/plandrop/config.json`, then `/etc/plandrop/config.json`, then the Homebrew `etc`
  prefixes. Read-only to the CLI (`init` never writes it). The per-user config also gains a
  `template` key, ranked below a `.plandrop`'s `template` in template precedence.
- **`server` command + `curl | bash` starter** — the canonical way to stand up a plandrop
  server is now `curl -fsSL https://plandrop.dev/start.sh | sh` (the committed
  `scripts/start.sh`, served from plandrop.dev); `npx plandrop server` downloads and runs the
  same starter. It requires Docker + Compose (clear message and non-zero exit when missing —
  it never installs anything), writes a localhost-defaults `.env` if none exists, fetches the
  self-contained `compose.proxy.yml`, pulls the prebuilt GHCR images, and brings the stack up
  on `http://localhost:8083` — no domain, DNS, or TLS proxy. Re-runnable; tracks `latest`
  unless `PLANDROP_VERSION` pins a release.
- **`create` offers the Claude Code autosync hook** — after minting a host, an interactive
  `create` offers (opt-in) to scaffold a `PostToolUse` hook in the project's
  `.claude/settings.json` that republishes a watched HTML document via `plandrop upload`
  whenever it is saved, prompting for the path to watch (default `docs/*.html`). The merge
  preserves existing settings and hooks and skips cleanly when an equivalent hook is already
  present. Non-interactive control via `--hook`/`--no-hook`/`--hook-path <glob>`.

### Changed

- **`upload` prints the file URL** — a single-file upload now prints the full shareable URL
  including the filename (the exact path it PUT to), so the link opens the document directly;
  a directory upload still prints the host root.

### Fixed

- **`create` no longer hangs on an unreachable host** — control-plane requests (`create`,
  `rotate`, `remove`, and `newdoc`'s template fetches) are bounded by a 10s timeout, so a
  domain that resolves but silently drops the connection (e.g. a LAN-only server addressed
  from off-LAN) fails with a clear "no response from `<host>` — is it reachable on your
  network?" instead of hanging forever.
- **Prompted commands exit cleanly** — stdin is paused and unref'd after every prompt (TTY
  included), so an interactive `create` returns to the shell after printing its result instead
  of keeping the process alive.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-28

### Changed

- **Self-contained server images** — every service now bakes its own config into its image,
  so the running stack is a true black box: the compose file plus a `.env` (and the `data/`
  tree) is all a deployer needs, with no repo checkout for host-side config. The Apache vhost
  config (`apache/httpd.conf`, with `${PLANDROP_APACHE_PORT}` still interpolated at runtime)
  ships in a new `ghcr.io/xalior/plandrop-apache` image, and the dev front-proxy config in
  `ghcr.io/xalior/plandrop-proxy`; both are multi-arch (`amd64`, `arm64`, `arm/v7`) and built
  by the publish workflow alongside `ingress`/`control`. Genuine runtime data and operator
  content (the `data/` tree, the operator `user-templates` drop-in, the seeded theme volume)
  stay as mounts. Building from source (`docker compose up -d --build`) still works.

### Documentation

- **Documented `newdoc`** in the [client usage guide](usage.md) — it was previously absent.
  Covers the no-host default (scaffolds from plandrop.dev's static, publish-less templates),
  the `--template` / `--domain` flags and their precedence, and static-vs-self-updating
  behaviour.
- **Corrected the stack description** in the README and docs index to the **three** containers
  (nginx ingress + Apache `mod_dav` host + control plane), not two — the ingress was missing.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- **`newdoc` works without a host** — `newdoc` no longer requires a `.plandrop`. It resolves
  its template server by the usual precedence (`--domain` flag > `PLANDROP_DOMAIN` > nearest
  `.plandrop` > user config) and, with nothing configured, defaults to **plandrop.dev** — so
  `npx plandrop newdoc plan.html` scaffolds a document out of the box. Pointed at plandrop.dev
  you get **static, publish-less** templates (assets referenced by absolute
  `https://plandrop.dev/.plandrop/…` URLs, so the document renders standalone — even opened as
  a `file://` URL — and carrying the shared self-update script, which lies dormant on `file://`
  and comes alive once the saved plan is hosted over HTTP(S)); pointed at your own host you get
  that host's self-updating ones. Unlike `create`, `newdoc` never prompts — the default stands
  in for it.

- **Prebuilt container images on GHCR** — the `ingress` and `control` images are published
  to `ghcr.io/xalior/plandrop-ingress` and `ghcr.io/xalior/plandrop-control` on each release
  tag, multi-arch (`amd64`, `arm64`, `arm/v7`). `docker-compose.yml` references them so
  `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` runs the stack with no local build; pin a
  release with `PLANDROP_VERSION` (default `latest`). Building from source still works with
  `docker compose up -d --build`.

### Changed

- **One shared `selfupdate.js`, not one per theme** — the self-update script is now seeded once
  at the theme-neutral `.plandrop/shared/js/selfupdate.js` and referenced by every template,
  instead of being copied byte-for-byte into all 27 theme folders (the per-theme CSS still
  differs and stays per theme). A fix to the update logic no longer means regenerating every
  theme. The script gained a `file://` guard — it no-ops when there is no host to poll — so it
  now also ships with the statically-scaffolded plandrop.dev templates for local plans.

### Fixed

- **Dark-theme navbar contrast** — the navbar in single-appearance Bootswatch themes now
  carries `data-bs-theme` on the navbar element itself, not just on `<html>`. Bootswatch
  gates its dark-navbar colours on the `.navbar[data-bs-theme=dark]` attribute selector,
  which doesn't match an inherited value, so the brand/links in dark themes (cyborg,
  darkly, slate, solar, superhero, vapor) were falling back to a near-black `#222` on a
  dark bar. The dual-mode `bootstrap5` skeleton is left inheriting so its light/dark toggle
  still flips the navbar with the page.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-23

Templates & themes, served behind a new nginx ingress.

### Added

- **`newdoc <filename>` command** — scaffold a template-based HTML document onto the
  local filesystem from a server-hosted template, named exactly as asked. Refuses to
  overwrite an existing file without `--force`. Template precedence: `--template` flag >
  the `.plandrop` `template` field > `default`.
- **Templates & themes** — a shipped set built on Bootstrap: `bootstrap5` (stock Bootstrap,
  light + dark) as the default, plus the full Bootswatch theme set. Each is self-hosted
  (no runtime CDN). `GET /api/templates` lists what's available.
- **`create --template <name>`** — pin a host's default template in `.plandrop`.
- **Configurable default template** — `PLANDROP_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE` (defaults to
  `bootstrap5`); resolved to a concrete name at scaffold time so existing documents never
  break when the default changes.
- **Operator drop-in templates** — a bind-mounted `/.plandrop/user/` tree; operator
  templates appear namespaced as `user/<name>` and are selectable like any other.
- **Shared template assets over `/.plandrop/`** — Apache serves each template's CSS/JS/etc.
  read-only under a hidden per-host path.
- **Branded directory listings** — a host root with no `index.html` is served as an
  autoindex wrapped in the default template's chrome, with a per-host `.header.html` /
  `.footer.html` override.
- **Self-updating documents** — a published document detects when it has been re-uploaded
  and swaps its content in place, with no manual refresh.
- Bootswatch + Bootstrap (MIT) attribution carried in the template footer alongside
  `plandrop.dev`.

### Changed

- **nginx ingress is now the sole public control entrypoint.** It serves the template
  statics and reverse-proxies `/api/*` to the control plane. The **control plane is now
  internal-only**, reachable only through the ingress on the docker network — never
  host-published — leaving the ingress as the single inbound chokepoint.
- The stack is now **three containers** (ingress + apache + control). The control plane's
  port is a fixed internal constant, no longer an operator setting; operators configure
  only the public ingress and apache ports.
- Themes render in their **native mode**: the light/dark toggle is offered only on the
  dual-mode `bootstrap5`; single-appearance Bootswatch themes render as designed.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-21

Initial proof-of-concept: push a finished static HTML document to a unique, secure
hostname and share the link, with zero server-side logic on the hosting path.

### Added

- **`npx plandrop` CLI** — `create` (mint a host: a unique hostname + passphrase, written
  to a local `.plandrop` file), `upload` (push a file or directory over authenticated
  WebDAV), `rotate` (change the passphrase), `remove` (delete the host and its content).
- **Control plane** (Node/Hono) — mints, rotates, and removes hosts; the sole writer of
  the per-tenant content tree and the bcrypt `htpasswd`.
- **Static + WebDAV host** (Apache `mod_dav`) — one dynamic vhost serves every subdomain:
  open reads, per-tenant authenticated writes (htpasswd username = the bare host label);
  cross-tenant and anonymous writes are denied (401).
- **Docker Compose stack** (apache + control), `.env` configuration, and the `.plandrop`
  dotfile with domain resolution (flag > env > nearest `.plandrop` > user config > prompt).
- Licensed **LGPL-3.0-only**.
